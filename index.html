Hello! I’m <strong>Prajakta Kini</strong>, a 2nd-year Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on neuro-symbolic approaches, improving interpretability and alignment in large language models (LLMs), and meta-reasoning in LLMs.

Currently, I am advised by [Dr. Maria Pacheco](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/maria-l-pacheco) in the [BLAST](https://blast-cu.github.io/) Lab, where I am exploring neuro-symbolic methods for meta-reasoning—developing ways for LLMs to evaluate and improve their own reasoning processes.

From Sept 2024 – Aug 2025, I also worked with [Dr. Theodora Chaspari](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/theodora-chaspari) in the HUBBS Lab on bias detection and fairness in mental health NLP. Our paper, `Assessing Algorithmic Bias in Language-Based Depression Detection: A Comparison of DNN and LLM Approaches`, has been accepted at the [BHI 2025](https://bhi.embs.org/2025/) conference.

Before graduate school, I worked as a Software Developer at Uber and VMware in India for over four years, which gave me a strong foundation in large-scale software development. More recently, I interned as a Summer SDE Intern at PhonePe, USA (June–August 2025).

Outside of academics, I enjoy listening to music and experimenting with cooking, helping me unwind and explore creativity in different ways.
