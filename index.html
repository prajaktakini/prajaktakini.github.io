<p>Hello! I'm <strong>Prajakta Kini</strong>, a 2nd-year Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on neuro-symbolic approaches, improving interpretability and alignment in large language models (LLMs), and meta-reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p>Currently, I am advised by <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/maria-l-pacheco">Dr. Maria Pacheco</a> in the <a href="https://blast-cu.github.io/">BLAST</a> Lab, where I am exploring neuro-symbolic methods for meta-reasoning—developing ways for LLMs to evaluate and improve their own reasoning processes.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am advised by <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/alvaro-velasquez">Dr. Alvaro Velasquez</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/amritsinghbedi/home">Dr. Amrit Singh Bedi</a> on AI misalignment and scheming detection, where I am developing benchmarks for evaluating covert misalignment in advanced AI systems.</p>
<p>From Sept 2024 – Aug 2025, I also worked with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/theodora-chaspari">Dr. Theodora Chaspari</a> in the HUBBS Lab on bias detection and fairness in mental health NLP. Our paper, "Assessing Algorithmic Bias in Language-Based Depression Detection: A Comparison of DNN and LLM Approaches", has been accepted at the <a href="https://bhi.embs.org/2025/">BHI 2025</a> conference.</p>

<p>Before graduate school, I worked as a Software Developer at Uber and VMware in India for over four years, which gave me a strong foundation in large-scale software development. More recently, I interned as a Summer SDE Intern at PhonePe, USA (June–August 2025).</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy listening to music and experimenting with cooking, helping me unwind and explore creativity in different ways.</p>
