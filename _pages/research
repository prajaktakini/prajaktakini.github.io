My research focuses on developing more reliable and interpretable AI systems through neurosymbolic approaches and bias assessment.

## Current Projects

### Neurosymbolic Meta-Reasoning
Developing frameworks that enable Large Language Models to evaluate and improve their own reasoning processes by combining neural and symbolic approaches.

### Algorithmic Bias in Healthcare AI
Investigating bias patterns in AI systems used for mental health applications, comparing traditional deep learning with modern LLM approaches.

## Recent Projects (2024-2025)

- **Assessing Algorithmic Bias in Language-Based Depression Detection** - Paper submitted to BHI 2025 Conference
- **Structured Reasoning with LLMs for Question Answering over Tabular Data** - Spring 2025
- **Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Depression Detection** - Fall 2024
- **Detection of Insomnia from Clinical Notes** - Spring 2025
- **SmartMeet â€“ AI Meeting Summarizer** - Full-stack NLP application (Fall 2024)
