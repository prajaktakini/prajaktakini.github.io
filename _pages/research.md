My research lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on neuro-symbolic approaches, improving interpretability and alignment in large language models (LLMs), and meta-reasoning in LLMs.

## Current Projects

### NeuSyM-Meta: Neuro-Symbolic Meta-Reasoning for Self-Aware Logical Evaluation in Large Language Models
Explore and develop neuro-symbolic methods for meta-reasoning that enable large language models (LLMs) to evaluate and improve their own reasoning processes.
